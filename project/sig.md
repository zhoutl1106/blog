# Signal Generator

My thesis of B.Eng. 

This project contains two parts, an ARM-based GUI control unit, and an FPGA-based DDS signal generator. Users can choose from many typical waveforms and set up the parameters. These parameters will be transferred to FPGA through SPI. I fixed these two parts in a single case and it looks pretty neat.
