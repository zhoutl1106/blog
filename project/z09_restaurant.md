# Restaurant digital menu

At the end of my undergrad, one of my friend told me he will start a small restaurant in campus and asked if I could develop a digital menu on tablet, which will attract more students. I built a digital menu for each table to place orders, as well as a management app for the front desk to manage eat-in and deliver orders.
