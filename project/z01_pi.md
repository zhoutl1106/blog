# Raspberry PI based personal reliable storage

This is the work of my first year of Ph.D. program in University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This system consists several raspberry pis as storage nodes. An erasure coding algorithm has been deployed onto them such that even some nodes broken, we can still ensure the data safety.

Moreover, for convenient configure these nodes, I also attached a NFC module to nodes (not shown in pictures, only for concept proofing purpose).
