# Airforce Game

My practice of graphic programming in Qt, has also been used as an example in my classes.

There was a popular mini game also called "AirForce" in WeChat (Chinese version WhatsApp like, but much more powerful). 
I spent quite a bit time on it and decided to make a simple clone for practice of graphic programming. 

Its source code could be found at [here](https://github.com/zhoutl1106/AirForceGame_demo)
