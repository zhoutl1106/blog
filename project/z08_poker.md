# Cards

This project was a class project of sophomore year. The original requirement was building a CLI application which can shuffle a deck of cards and print them out.

I was learning MFC programming at that time, so I thought to give it a more fancy way to display. Input arguments like number of players using a dialog and display real card image instead of plain text gave a much intuitive way of interaction.
