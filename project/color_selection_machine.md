# Grain seed color selection machine

When working as a student developer in department of science, Harbin Engineering University. I received a task to build an industrial control unit for a grain seed color selection machine. The sensors on the conveyer will scan each grain seed and report result to control unit through serial port.

I cross-compiled the Qt library and built this control unit. Running on an embedded Linux system. For future firmware update, I also add the Wi-Fi function so it will be able to upgrade wirelessly.
