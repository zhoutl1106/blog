# Teaching

Teaching students programming is another interesting part of my life. Both in United States and China.

    In 2017 summer, my advisor and me had an opportunity to join the HITES11 in University of Tennessee. HITES11 (High school Introduction To Engineering Systems for 11th graders) is a summer campus program for 11th grade high school students. It shows many different interesting works in UTK to attract more high school graduates applying engineering related majors.

During this program, I created the study plan including introduction to python, introduction to raspberry pi, introduction to OpenCV, image processing and movement detection using OpenCV. Six high school students chose our group and successfully finished the project.

## Programming and application development for undergrads

I attended Harbin Engineering University (哈尔滨工程大学) in China for my bachelor and master degree. It has a wonderful program that allow junior, senior undergrads and graduate students open classes on their proficient area. 

I opened a programming class focus on C++/Qt framework for three semesters. A total of ~50 students passed and got credit. The example code I used is the "AirForce" in the project post [Here](../project/airforce).
