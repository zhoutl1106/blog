# Book: Introduction to Bitcoin

This is a popular science oriented book to public who interested in Bitcoin. I'm a co-author who write the first few chapters describing some background information about Bitcoin and the mathematical principle behind.

In the rest chapters, other authors gave detailed instruction on how to use Bitcoin wallet, trading with Bitcoin, and "mining" using computer.
